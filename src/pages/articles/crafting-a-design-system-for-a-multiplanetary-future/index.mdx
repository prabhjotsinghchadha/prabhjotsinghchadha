I use Neovim as my main editor for programming and developing any application. Neovim is much faster as compare to VSCode or other applications. In this artice I will tell you how you can configure your Neovim for daily programming activities.

Neovim is getting more popular and it's plugins have been evolved so well. I’d like to share my latest setup for coding React and TypeScript based apps. The config files are written in Lua language. We will be using Packer for our package installation. If you have
dotfiles already with you, you can take some inspiration from my dotfiles. I hope you enjoy it.
